Project 4 

Link to my project code on github:


A description of the MDPs used can be found in the analysis pdf
This project used CMU's Reinforcement Learning Simulator.
The original source can be found here:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/
The fork I used (which has helpful image-saving features) can be found here:
https://github.com/theJenix/rl_sim_fork

The compiled RLSim jar is included in my submission, along with the source.

To run RLSim, do:
`java -cp rl.jar MainUI`

The problem mazes used were:

Small map:
4_multipleGoals2.maze

Large Map:
7_medium_complex_multigoal.maze
